# About Me

Hi, I’m **Arsh Imtiaz**. I work as a **Cyber Security Engineer**, mostly living in the space between penetration testing, secure architecture review, cloud and platform security, and automotive cybersecurity. I enjoy understanding how complex systems fail, how attackers think, and how to build things that don’t fall apart under pressure.

I’m not really a “just run tools” kind of person. I like digging into systems, protocols, logs, and strange behaviours until I actually understand what's going on. That curiosity pretty much shaped my entire career.

## What I Do

My work sits across offensive and defensive security. Some days I’m deep in **threat modelling**, **trust-boundary analysis**, or **regulatory security verification**. Other days I’m testing protocols, writing PoCs, analysing logs, or figuring out why a system behaves weirdly under certain inputs.

I’ve worked across automotive platforms, embedded systems, Linux environments, cloud infrastructure, and distributed software. That mix has taught me how to look at security from an engineering perspective, not just from a testing one.

If you want the career-version of this story, it’s all on my

## TryHackMe Progress

I started learning cybersecurity because I liked breaking things (ethically). TryHackMe was where I spent a lot of time early on, working through challenges and improving my fundamentals. I eventually hit the **highest level** and ranked in the **Top 1% globally**, which was a nice milestone on the way.

## Outside of Work

I’m usually either:
- breaking things in my **personal cybersecurity lab**
- building random tools in **Python or Bash**
- messing with **Linux** (I run Arch and customise everything I touch)
- experimenting with distributed systems or weird side projects
- writing on my blog about whatever I’m learning that week

I enjoy documenting my journey because it keeps me honest, and it helps people who are moving through the same path I did.
